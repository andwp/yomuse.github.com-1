近段时间用着诸如ikindle之类的"One Place"，推送着自以为不错读物到K3，期间重温了余华的《许三观卖血记》、《活着》与《兄弟》、狄更斯的《双城记》、以及正在阅读的《博尔赫斯小说集》......
阅读着这样的作品总是会突然的觉得平静，也仿佛就会置身于那段重未踏碎的时光或是重未染指的情节，然后就开始有了一些被人们称为“装B的思考”......同时拜TLF所赐，前段日子也D完了 AFI TOP 100,让我从《公民凯恩》到《码头工人》到《宾虚》......

 看了N部从昏昏欲睡到“欲罢不能”到似有所悟的佳片......最后，以《双城记》记之：

原文：It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way–in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only.

翻译：那是最美好的时代，那是最糟糕的时代；那是智慧的年头，那是愚昧的年头；那是信仰的时期，那是怀疑的时期；那是光明的季节，那是黑暗的季节；那是希望的春天，那是失望的冬天；我们拥有一切，我们一无所有;我们全都在直奔天堂，我们全都在直奔相反的方向–简而言之，那时跟现在非常相象，某些最喧嚣的权威坚持要用形容词的最高级来形容它。说它好，是最高级的；说它不好，也是最高级的。
